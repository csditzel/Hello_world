	<p>I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. <br>
		Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, <br>
		trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, <br>
		changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, <br>
		and more importantly, you're doing something. </p></p>
	So that's my wish for you, <br>
		and all of us, and my wish for myself. <br>Make new mistakes. Make glorious, <br>
	amazing mistakes. Make mistakes nobody's ever made before. <br>
	Don't freeze, don't stop, don't worry that it isn't good enough, <br>
	or it isn't perfect, whatever it is: art, or love, or work or family or life. <br>
	<p></p>
	Whatever it is you're scared of doing, do it. Make your mistakes, next year and forever.</h5><p></p>
